# ðŸ“š Quotes App (Expo + React Native)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project was created to learn best practices and challenge myself, as it is my first meaningful React Native project.

A mobile application built with Expo, displaying random quotes and a paginated list of quotes. It includes:

- **Expo Router** â€“ bottom-tabs navigation with Home / Quotes / Favorites.
- **React Query** (`@tanstack/react-query`) â€“ infinite scroll, pull-to-refresh, state handling
- **Axios** â€“ typed client (API layer in `/services`).
- **Global Theme** (light/dark) + `AppThemeSwitcher` with animated icon.
- **TypeScript** 100 %
- **Jest + @testing-library/react-native** â€“ logical coverage 80%+.
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ lint â†’ tests â†’ coverage badge

#### Future implementation:

- **Storage** - need to check how it works
- and more...
